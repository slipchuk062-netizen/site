<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to overhaul a website for a master's thesis project. The core requirements are:
- Globally change and improve the data clustering visualization to be the centerpiece of the project.
- The final product must look professional and appealing to tourists, while still being suitable for a master's thesis (implying robust analytics presented clearly).
- Implement features such as:
    - Visualization of cluster data.
    - Calculation and visualization of object density.
    - A heatmap for popular areas.
    - A clear, performant map with accurate boundaries for the Zhytomyr region and its districts, with an option for 3D rotation.
    - A recommendation system for tourists.
    - Integration of object details like reviews and opening hours from Google Places API, supplemented by a local review and visit statistics system.
    - A feature for other organizations to upload their own data files for analysis.
    - A polished UI with dynamic background images of the Zhytomyr region.

**User's preferred language**: Ukrainian

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application (React/FastAPI) that is largely functional and feature-complete according to the user's recent requests. Key features include:
- A professional clustering visualization dashboard with interactive charts and real-time metrics ().
- A detailed analytics page () with multiple tabs for in-depth data exploration (cluster distribution, density, etc.).
- An interactive map () with accurate, visually distinct boundaries for the four new districts of Zhytomyr Oblast, sourced from OpenStreetMap.
- A Top 10 Places component displaying popular attractions.
- Backend endpoints serving analytics data and enabling the download of generated assets like presentations and guides.
- The agent has also acted as a defense coach, creating a full PowerPoint presentation, a defense guide (), and other explanatory documents to help the user prepare for their thesis defense.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user requested key graphs from the system to be included in their presentation. The agent captured a screenshot of the main clustering visualization page and was in the process of creating a downloadable asset package for the user.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** NA (The task is to generate assets, not test application functionality).
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Provide the user with the requested graphs for their presentation. (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1: Provide the user with the requested graphs for their presentation.**
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent took one screenshot of the main dashboard.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. Capture screenshots of other key graphs (e.g., detailed analytics on the  page, density map, elbow method plot).
        2. Package these images into a single, easily downloadable format like a PDF or a ZIP archive.
        3. Create or update a backend endpoint to serve this new asset package.
        4. Provide the direct download link to the user.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a direct and final request to help the user complete their master's thesis presentation.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (to test the new download endpoint).
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Generate and provide presentation graphs.**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent has taken one screenshot. The next step is to capture the remaining essential graphs and package them for download.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The user will have all the visual materials needed to finalize their presentation slides.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend.
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - (P1) Implement map rotation/3D view.
    - (P2) Implement a local review and visit statistics system.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - (P3) Re-evaluate and enhance the design of the Top 10 most visited places section.
    - (P4) Implement the feature for other organizations to upload their own data files for analysis.
    - (P4) Re-evaluate the 3D Virtual Tour feature.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Map & Metrics Fixed:** Sourced accurate GeoJSON for Zhytomyr Oblast's four districts, updated , and improved map styling. Fixed frontend metrics to show correct backend data.
- **Analytics UI Finalized:** Removed deprecated components and implemented a View Detailed Analytics button linking to a comprehensive analytics page ().
- **Presentation & Defense Prep:** Created a complete, professional PowerPoint presentation () with generated charts and text based on the user's sample and feedback.
- **Documentation Created:** Generated multiple markdown files to help the user prepare for their defense, including , , and text for specific presentation slides.
- **Download Functionality:** Added backend endpoints to allow the user to download the generated presentation and guide documents.
- **Acted as Defense Coach:** Answered detailed questions about the project's technical aspects, scientific novelty, and alignment with the thesis topic, and rewrote presentation text based on user feedback.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Leaflet.js, , Chart.js
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), , 
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Data Sourcing:** OpenStreetMap (Overpass API), Google Places API
- **ML/Analytics:** K-means, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Score

**key DB schema**
- **Needed additions (still pending):**
    - : {attraction_id, user_name, rating, text, created_at}
    - : {attraction_id, count}

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is in the final stages of preparing for their master's thesis defense. The priority is no longer feature development but generating assets and documentation for their presentation.
- Act as a knowledgeable project partner. The user relies on the agent to explain complex concepts and assist with writing and structuring their defense materials.
- All communication with the user **must** be in Ukrainian.

**documents created in this job**
- 
- 
- 
- 
- Several other helper  and  files for the presentation.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:** The local review system and map rotation are not implemented, but the core functionality of the application is working and robust.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Google Places API:** Actively used to fetch attraction details. Requires a User API Key (configured).
- **Emergent LLM Key:** Used for the AI Assistant feature. The key is configured.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, the frontend testing agent was used after fixing the map and metrics. It passed successfully.
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
